# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (SVD)

**NSDC Data Science Project**

Welcome! 👋
This repository contains a **movie recommendation system** built using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. The project is designed as a **learning-focused data science project**, with both a **starter (blank) version** and a **fully completed version** so you can follow along, practice, and compare your work.



## 📖 About This Project

Recommendation systems power many platforms we use every day — Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and more. In this project, we build a **collaborative filtering movie recommender** using SVD and the **MovieLens 100k dataset**.
This project is part of the **NSDC Data Science curriculum** and is meant to be hands-on and practical.


## 📊 Dataset

**MovieLens 100k Dataset**

* 100,000 ratings
* 943 users
* 1,682 movies
* Ratings from 1–5
