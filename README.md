#  Movie Recommendation System (SVD)

**NSDC Data Science Project**

Welcome! 
This repository contains a **movie recommendation system** built using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. The project is designed as a **learning-focused data science project**, with both a **starter (blank) version** and a **fully completed version** so you can follow along, practice, and compare your work.



##  About This Project

Recommendation systems power many platforms we use every day — Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and more. In this project, we build a collaborative-filtering movie recommender using SVD and the MovieLens 100k dataset.
This project is part of the **NSDC Data Science curriculum** and is meant to be hands-on and practical.


##  Dataset

**MovieLens 100k Dataset**

* 100,000 ratings
* 943 users
* 1,682 movies
* Ratings from 1–5


## Tools & Technologies

* Python 
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn / Surprise (for SVD)
* Jupyter Notebook (recommended)

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: SVD Crash Course

* Learn what SVD is
* Understand how it applies to recommendation systems
* Discuss strengths and limitations

### Milestone 2: Data Preprocessing

* Load and explore the dataset
* Clean and prepare data for modeling
* Understand user–item interactions

### Milestone 3: Hyperparameter Tuning
